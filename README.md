# PawSwipe

Development of an app for human-animal mediation, which is being developed as part of the "Software Lab" event at [Heilbronn University](https://www.hs-heilbronn.de/de).

## Installation
<!--Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. -->

## Usage
<!--Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.-->

## Authors and acknowledgment
<!--Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.-->

## Project status
<!--If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.-->
